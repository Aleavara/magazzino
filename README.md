Java project for warehouse management that involves interaction between two main classes: 'Prodotto' product and "Magazzino" Warehouse

we also implemented a JUnit test class and another one "SalvaFile" to help the users by saving all the warehouse infos in a readable file.
The main class allows users to interect with the classes, like modifying a product, add/delete products etc..

we're planning on making some major changes in the future, so if you have any suggestion let us know!
A special thanks to professor A. Baroni and @vitellimc for allowing us to realize the project.
